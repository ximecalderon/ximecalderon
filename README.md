### Hi there, I'm Ximena 👋
A software Engineer, cloud developer and full-stack web development instructor

Fun facts:
- 🎨 I'm an architect (of buildings) too, and got into coding and AWS by creating an educational web platform about architecture representation
- 👁️ I'm a visual thinker, so I create awesome diagrams to plan software, and later use them as documentation
- 🤓 I tend to get very nerdy about understanding the things I find interesting. "What makes this what it is? How does it work at a low level?". Applies to tech, all my hobbies, and even the people I surround mysef with.
